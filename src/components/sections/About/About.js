                Manam Solutions founded in 2018 to help solve critical pain points for enterprise IT organizations and the managed service providers (MSPs) that serve them. From on-premises to hybrid IT, multi-cloud, edge computing and shadow IT, itâ€™s a tough world for IT operations teams to manage and optimize. Disconnected point tools miss the point. And stitched together legacy IT operations management (ITOM) suites were not built for the modern era.
                </p>
                <p>
                The Manam IT operations management (MTOM) platform allows you to see everything in your hybrid IT environment, take the right action faster with integrated event and incident management and automate with confidence with AIOps. Learn more about our service-centric AIOps platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                With Manam, you can detect and resolve incidents faster, understand resource dependencies and avoid costly performance issues that result in lost revenue and productivity.
